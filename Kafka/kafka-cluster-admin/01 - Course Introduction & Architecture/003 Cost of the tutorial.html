<p>As an experienced cloud architect and Kafka expert,<strong> it cost me $1.5 dollars</strong> to recordthis course. I was very efficient and recorded all the videos in a row, in one day.</p>

<p>This tutorial may cost you more money, <strong>plan for $10</strong>. Additionally, if you plan on running your Kafka cluster continuously, it will obviouslycost you an ongoing fee.

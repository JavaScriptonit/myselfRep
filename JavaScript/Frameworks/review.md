### Conclusion:

To choose a JavaScript test automation framework, consider several variables:

How many types of apps and configurations do you need to support? Frameworks like WebdriverIO are the most extensible.

Do you need to test mobile as well as desktop apps? If so, frameworks that broadly support both types of apps, like WebdriverIO, are a good choice.

How robust and mature do you want the framework to be? Frameworks like Puppeteer, TestCafe, and WebdriverIO are tried-and-true.

Do you need a framework that can handle front-end as well as back-end testing, like Cypress?

How quick and easy do you want it to be to write, configure, and run tests? Currently, frameworks like Puppeteer and Playwright require some relatively complex configuration, especially if you are not using them for the narrow use cases that they support out-of-the-box.
